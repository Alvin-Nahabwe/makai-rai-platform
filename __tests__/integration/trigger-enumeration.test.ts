/**
 * The phase-exit review of this branch (2026-08-05) found two security
 * controls that were fully built, correctly reasoned about in ADR-0002, and
 * completely inert: `bumpSessionEpoch` (lib/auth/identity.ts) had zero
 * production callers, and `mustChangePassword` was read into the `Identity`
 * type and returned by `resolveIdentity` but nothing downstream ever
 * branched on it (the one place that used to — `proxy.ts` — read the flag
 * off a JWT claim ADR-0002 §3 had already removed from the token, so it
 * type-checked and silently evaluated to `undefined` forever).
 *
 * `port-completeness.test.ts` and `preauth-surface.test.ts` enumerate
 * SURFACES from disk (routes, exported functions) — neither would have
 * caught this, because both defects were fully-formed, exported,
 * correctly-typed surface. What was missing was a TRIGGER: something that
 * actually calls the exported guard, or actually branches on the flag it
 * reads. This suite enumerates triggers the same mechanical way
 * `org-context.test.ts`'s "OrgContext construction is enumerable" test
 * enumerates `createOrgContext`'s importers — from disk, on every run, so a
 * regression that quietly re-orphans either control fails a test, not a
 * future review.
